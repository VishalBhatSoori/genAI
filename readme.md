# My Generative AI Learning Journey 🧠

Welcome to my personal repository for exploring the fascinating world of Generative AI! This space is a living journal of my hands-on projects, experiments, and learnings as I delve into different models, tools, and techniques.

## 🚀 Projects

This repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific project or concept I've explored.

### 1. Command-Line Chat with Context (Node.js)

- **Folder:** `storeHistory/`
- **Description:** A simple command-line interface (CLI) application that allows you to have a continuous conversation with a Large Language Model (LLM). It remembers the previous turns of the conversation to provide contextually relevant responses.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Interacting with an LLM API from a server-side environment.
  - Managing conversational history for context-aware interactions.
  - Using Node.js for backend scripting.
  - Handling user input in a terminal application.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Backend:** Node.js
- **LLM:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Node Packages:**
  - `@google/generative-ai`: The official Google AI SDK for Node.js.
  - `readline-sync`: To synchronously get user input from the command line.
  - `dotenv`: To manage environment variables (like API keys) safely.
